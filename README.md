# Automated-annotation-of-GIS-workflows-using-knowledge-graph-embedding-KGE-

Project about automated annotation of GIS workflows using knowledge graph embeddings. 

Geo-analytical question answering with AI can be complicated, since the solutions to such problems are indirect, as we cannot just find the answer in the knowledge base. One of the ways to approach it is to use core concepts of spatial information, which distinguish geo-semantics, to interpret both questions and workflows (answers). Geographical Information Systems (GIS) processes occurring in these workflows can then be annotated by the core concept data (CCD) types which combine data forms with their semantics. I worked with the data provided by the QuAnGIS team, which currently does such annotations manually. Therefore, I wanted to test whether and how Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) models can help with the automatisation of this process. I tested RESCAL and ConvE models and how they behave with geo-specific data. Despite some positive results, the automatic annotation is rather challenging and gives inconclusive results, with the current state of the data used in the QuAnGIS project. 

This project was done as my graduation project for the Applied Data Science master at Utrecht University.  In order to see the paper, please contact me.
